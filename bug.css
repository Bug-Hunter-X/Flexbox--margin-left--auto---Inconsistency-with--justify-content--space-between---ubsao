The following CSS code snippet exhibits unexpected behavior in certain browsers:

```css
.container {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-between;
}

.item {
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
  background-color: lightblue;
}

.item:nth-child(2) {
  margin-left: auto;
}
```

While intending for the second item to be aligned to the right, it only partially works in some browsers. The `margin-left: auto;` is being applied after `justify-content: space-between;` has already distributed the space, resulting in unexpected spacing.
